<p class="sectionTag text-big">Basic stop motion production process is as follows:</p>
<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The scene is modeled in real life with props, objects, and materials.
    The characters are all created along with their different positions and facial expressions, and then set in the appropriate scene.
    The scene is lit and composed and then it’s ready to be photographed.
    The characters and scenes are then adjusted slightly, and another photograph is taken.
    This process is repeated, adjusting the characters and scenes every time until the desired animation and pacing is fully photographed.
    All of the photographs are then compiled together to create a 3D animation completely done with hand-made photography
    

On the other hand, if it is for mathematics or physics, then I often write the main points that I need
to know, although these generally cover the whole theory as well.
